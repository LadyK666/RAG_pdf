    "report_string": "# 硫化氢 and Heavy Metal Removal Technology Community\n\nThe community is centered around the use of 硫化氢 (hydrogen sulfide) as a key component in the treatment of acidic wastewater for heavy metal removal. The technology involves a series of processes including gas generation, storage, and absorption, with entities such as 气体发生器 (gas generator), 储气罐 (gas storage tank), and 吸收塔 (absorption tower) playing pivotal roles. The process is notable for its high utilization rate of 硫化氢 and the recycling of 硫化钠溶液 (sodium sulfide solution), showcasing an efficient and sustainable approach to wastewater treatment.\n\n## 硫化氢 as the central technology\n\n硫化氢 is utilized as a sulfur source in the heavy metal removal process from acidic wastewater, with a utilization rate exceeding 99%. This high efficiency underscores its central role in the community, replacing sodium sulfide to avoid sodium ion contamination. The technology's reliance on 硫化氢 highlights its importance in achieving sustainable and efficient wastewater treatment.\n\n## Integration of 气体发生器 and 储气罐\n\nThe 气体发生器 (gas generator) and 储气罐 (gas storage tank) are integral to the process, where 硫化氢 is generated and stored before being used in the treatment process. This integration ensures a steady supply of 硫化氢 for the wastewater treatment, demonstrating the community's focus on process efficiency and safety.\n\n## Role of 吸收塔 in the process\n\nThe 吸收塔 (absorption tower) treats trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas with alkali absorption, converting it into sodium sulfide solution for reuse. This step not only mitigates the environmental impact of excess 硫化氢 but also contributes to the sustainability of the process by recycling by-products.\n\n## Recycling of 硫化钠溶液\n\n硫化钠溶液, generated in the absorption tower, is recycled back to the gas generator for the production of 硫化氢. This recycling mechanism enhances the process's sustainability by minimizing waste and reducing the need for fresh raw materials.\n\n## Use of 辅助剂 in 硫化氢 generation\n\n辅助剂 (auxiliary agent) is mixed with sulfidizing agents in a precise ratio to optimize the generation of 硫化氢 in the gas generator. This highlights the community's attention to detail in ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the 硫化氢 production process.",

Key entities include '重金属废水' (Heavy Metal Wastewater), '生物制剂' (Biological Agents), and '复合配位体水处理剂' (Complex Coordinated Water Treatment Agents). These entities are interconnected through various technologies and processes aimed at removing heavy metals like mercury, zinc, and cadmium ions, and ensuring compliance with national environmental standards.\n\n## Central Role of Heavy Metal Wastewater\n\nHeavy metal wastewater is the central concern of this community, originating from industries such as electronics, electroplating, and metal smelting. The wastewater contains hazardous metals like mercury, cadmium, and zinc, posing significant environmental and health risks. The community's efforts are directed towards treating this wastewater to remove or recover these metals, thereby reducing pollution and complying with environmental standards.\n\n## Innovative Use of Biological Agents\n\nBiological agents ('生物制剂') play a pivotal role in the community's wastewater treatment processes. These agents, composed of metabolic products from specific microbial communities, are designed to efficiently remove heavy metal ions through complex coordination. Their application in technologies like the '有色冶炼重金属废水生物制剂深度净化新工艺' (New Process for Deep Purification of Heavy Metal Wastewater from Non-ferrous Smelting Using Biological Agents) highlights their importance in achieving deep purification and metal recovery.\n\n## Compliance with National Environmental Standards\n\nA significant aspect of the community's activities is ensuring that treated wastewater meets national environmental standards, such as the '电镀污染物排放标准 GB21900-2008' (GB21900-2008 Standard for Electroplating Pollutant Discharge) and '铅、锌工业污染物排放标准' (Lead and Zinc Industrial Pollutant Discharge Standards). Compliance with these standards is crucial for minimizing the environmental impact of industrial activities and protecting public health.\n\n## Resource Recovery from Wastewater\n\nBeyond treatment, the community emphasizes the recovery of valuable metals from wastewater, turning a potential pollutant into a resource. Technologies like '重金属资源化' (Heavy Metal Resource Recovery) enable the extraction and reuse of metals such as copper and lead, contributing to sustainable industrial practices and reducing the demand for virgin materials.\n\n## Technological Integration in Wastewater Treatment\n\nThe community integrates various technologies, including '水解反应池' (Hydrolysis Reaction Tanks), '斜管沉淀池' (Inclined Tube Settling Tanks), and '絮凝反应池' (Flocculation Reaction Tanks), to achieve comprehensive wastewater treatment. These technologies work in concert to remove heavy metals, adjust pH levels, and separate solids from liquids, demonstrating a holistic approach to environmental management.",
